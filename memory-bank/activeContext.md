## Current Focus

**Architectural Planning Phase Complete** - The complete architecture for a production-ready full-stack TypeScript monorepo has been designed and documented. Ready for implementation in Code mode.

### Key Deliverables Created:
1. **ARCHITECTURE.md** - Comprehensive architecture documentation covering all aspects of the stack
2. **IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md** - Detailed step-by-step implementation instructions (Phase 1-3)
3. **IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE_PART2.md** - Continuation of implementation guide (Phase 4-5)

### Architecture Highlights:
- NPM workspaces monorepo with 3 packages (backend, frontend, shared)
- NestJS backend with TypeORM and SQLite
- React frontend with Vite and Tailwind CSS
- Shared TypeScript types package
- Comprehensive testing strategy (≥80% coverage)
- Full Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
- Production-ready code patterns
